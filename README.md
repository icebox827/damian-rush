## Design Process

The goal is to create a platform game where the main character is running, avoiding holes between platforms, collecting coins, avoiding fire endlessly.

### Story and gameplay

At first, the main idea was to create a game like Space Invader or Galaxy Defender and then came to my mind Temple Run, finally Super Mario Bros, one of my favorite childhood games.
So I decided to build a game mixing both Temple Run and Super Mario Bros idea, where the main character i.e the hero is running endlessly, avoiding holes, fire, and collecting coins.
I named the game Damian-Rush after the name of my son Damian as his birthday gift.

### Asset choices

I picked the assets by googling, and these include the player sprite, the coin, the fire, the platforms, the clouds, the background music, and the background.

### Before starting

I spent almost a day learning Phaser on Codecademy, and various Youtube videos. The official documentation is a great resource.

### Development stage
<!--Begin -->

> I started bynsetting up the environment, gathering assets, and make sure that Phaser is configured without problem.

> I created the different scenes for my game following the documentation, and my main objective was to create a basic phaser game with few functionnalities, which I did. This gives me some level of confidence because, from that point, I already have a deliverable.

> After that, I picked the scenes one after another, and I preloaded the required assets. I also link the scenes all together according to the game design, so I can move freely from one scene to another.

> Next, I added logic to animate player, the coin, and the fire. Having done these, I used object pool to add and remove platforms to the scene, and I add the bacground music.

> I later added logic to monitor collision between the player, the coin, the platform, and the fire. Lastly in the game scene, I added the scoring mechanism to keep track of the scores.

> A player does have to enter his name before playing the game. If a player did not enter his/her name, a warnong message will be displayed.
